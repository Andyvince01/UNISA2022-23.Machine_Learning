Real-time fire detection from image sequences is a crucial requirement 
in video surveillance applications, enabling the prevention of environmental disasters and ensuring continuous monitoring of urban and forest areas. To meet this 
demand, there is a growing interest in deploying "intelligent cameras" equipped 
with onboard video-analytics algorithms capable of detecting fires, such as 
flames and smoke, in real-time. These cameras are typically deployed in remote 
locations and need to be self-sufficient in terms of computational resources, with 
a small embedded system capable of processing the image sequence using a fire 
detection algorithm. In this context, our work presents a novel network model 
called **FireNetAGM**, which leverages the MobileNetV2 architecture for feature 
extraction from a sequence of video frames and utilizes an LSTM architecture to 
handle the temporal dynamics of the video.
